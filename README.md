# world_of_professions

This is an application that in the future will have a web portal so that students and other interested people 
can search and learn about the most varied professions, their areas of expertise and possibilities in the job market.
In this way, we seek to help from those who are at the beginning of their professional journey to those who dream of 
making a career transition.
